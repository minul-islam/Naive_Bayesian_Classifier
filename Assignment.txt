The attached csv file has data on the fitness of pilots to fly given a number of categorical variables concerning the flight worthiness of the pilot. The target variable we want to predict is the second column “TestRes/Var1” where 1 indicates the the aircraft is flight worthy, and 0 otherwise. Assume that the semantic meaning of the feature columns Var2 .. Var 6 are omitted for privacy and/or ethics reasons.

Implement a Naive Bayesian Classifier using python, that is, write python code to implement the classifier rather than use a library or module created by somebody else. DO NOT use a built-in python package such as scikit-learn for this.

 

Train your classifier on the provided dataset, and plot (using matplotlib) the ROC curve. 

 

b) 20 marks create a script that reads in the csv data file and stores it in a database.

 

c) 20 marks create a script that opens up a database and uses the data to train and plot the ROC curve for the classifier you created in part a) . Reuse your code from part a) as much as possible by encapsulating your part a) in a function and you may also re-use the database created in part a).

what are some advantages of the Bayesian Classifier (for example: when would you use this instead of Deep Learning)? 

Should we have split our data into training and validation sets? Justify your answer.

AND
